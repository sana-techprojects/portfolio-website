        <p>I'm a high school student passionate about technology, creativity, and making a difference. Whether it's coding innovative projects, 
            mentoring young programmers, or designing engaging experiences, I love bringing ideas to life. From leading my school's Computer 
            Science Club to developing award-winning tech solutions, I'm always exploring new ways to learn and grow. Outside of coding, you'll 
            find me volunteering, experimenting with design, or diving into a good book.

        </div>

        <div class="text">
          Last year, I participated in my first-ever 36-hour global hackathon, where my team and I created reMinda, a wearable device designed 
          to help Alzheimerâ€™s patients recognize loved ones without feeling disconnected from their families. This project was deeply personal to me 
          â€” my grandmother had Alzheimerâ€™s, and I witnessed firsthand how difficult it was for her to remember the people she loved.I took the lead on integrating the 
          hardware and software components by developing a custom glasses attachment with Arduino and programming a real-time facial recognition 
          system using OpenCV in Python. To ensure smooth identification, I built a MongoDB database to store and manage user profiles. 
          Additionally, I contributed to designing a GPS tracking dashboard that allowed families to monitor their loved onesâ€™ locations for 
          added safety. This project pushed me outside my comfort zone as I worked with hardware for the first time and tackled challenges like 
          cloud integration under tight deadlines. Our hard work paid off when we won 2nd place overall. More importantly, this experience 
          deepened my passion for using technology to solve meaningful problems!

        <div class="text">
          I created a video game called Witchâ€™s Garden, inspired by Plants vs. Zombies but with unique features that make the gameplay more 
          engaging and creative. I designed new settings, added more storytelling to immerse players in the gameâ€™s world, and incorporated 
          handmade digital art to give it a distinct visual style. The game was built using object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java on 
          Greenfoot. Each character and obstacle has its own class, making the code organized and modular. This project allowed me to blend 
          my love for coding with storytelling and art!

        <div class="text">
          I created a hospital simulation game that blends storytelling with interactive gameplay, built with object-oriented programming (OOP) 
          in Java on Greenfoot. Players manage patient care, handling unique health conditions and emergencies while making decisions that 
          impact outcomes. The game tracks these choices and presents results at the end, showing the consequences of each action. To add depth, 
          I incorporated storytelling elements that connect players to the patients, making decisions feel more meaningful. This project 
          strengthened my coding skills and taught me how to create engaging simulations that balance complexity and user experience.
